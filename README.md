# hwaware
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vedk/hwaware.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vedk/hwaware)
## What  is it?
**hwaware** is a Python webapp which addresses a very common issue of students: Forgetting the homework.
This webapp provides an interface for teachers to give homework which is then stored in a database (maybe MySQL) and then when the site is opened, the homework is displayed in a table.

I am currently using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org).

## Requirements
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org): `sudo pip install flask` for GNU/Linux and Macs and `python -m pip install flask` for Windows.

## How to run
On GNU/Linux and Macs run `python3 hwaware.py` and on Windows `python hwaware.py`; then open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

## How can you use it?
You can clone (`git clone https://github.com/vedk/hwaware.git`) the source once it's complete and add your school's logo and then you can host it where you want.

## Addition Notes
- **THIS WEBAPP ISN'T EVEN 10% COMPLETE**
- I plan to host this on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), from where everyone will be able to access this webapp.
